# March-Madness-2025

This is a project in my data science class to try and simulate the march madness tournament (2025) based on the stats of teams during the season. 
It is by no means a perfect model. fun little project. I suspect it will get most first round wins but, you know how march is, anything goes. 

make sure you have both the .csv files and the .rds file in your environment before attempting to run through the steps.
Once the for loop runs, if there is a high number of simulations run, it will take a little while.

check the sim_results csv file in your environment after you complete the 3rd script. That will have the probs of winning NCAAs.
(if yor sim number is set to 1, there will be no probabilities, just 1s and 0s)
